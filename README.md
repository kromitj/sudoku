TODO
  * Add functionality to change moves you've made to different numbers
  * Add undo function
  * Figure out how to fix the game_complete? function so the program knows when a player has finished the game
  * Create a library of sudoku levels
  * refactor the class, learn how to implement classes better
  * Memorize the spelling of sudoku :)
